This is my second task for level 1 at my internship with Cognifyz Technologies. It's created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The task involves changing the background of a button when the "clickme" button is clicked. This change is achieved by utilizing an array function containing four predefined colors.

                                                                              ======================= Screenshot =======================
